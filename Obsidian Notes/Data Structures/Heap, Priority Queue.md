## Heap

* Python has heapy.py
* Java has 
	* Sorted Set, Tree Set, and Priority Queue that can act as the same data structure. 

* One of the most famous usage is to keep the median in real time for a stream of comparable elements.
	* [[Fraudulant Activity Notifications]]

* Keeping track of the maximal element in the sliding window
	* [[Sliding Window Maximum]]
	* This is better solved with dynamic programming but using a Heap or Treeset or Tree map is still decent solution. 


## Alternatives Data Structure
* A tree set and tree map can be used as an alternative to the priority queue data structure
	* [[Tree Set, Tree Map]]
