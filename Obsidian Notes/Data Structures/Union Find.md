## Intro

* This data structure doesn't exists as a standard library in java, or python. 

* We will have to implement them manually

* It serves for the kruskal algorithm and detection of connected components almost exclusively. 
	* A good way of visualizing what it is doing: 
	* It collapse the whole component into one vertex inside of that component. 

* This data structure almost exclusively serves for the Kruskal's Minimum Spanning tree algorithm. 

* This data structure has been implemented in both python and java, and it's under the directory of [[Code Vault]]
